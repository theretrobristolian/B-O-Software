# Beovision STB-C Dumps (Set Top Box Controller)

## Summary

This page contains ROM dumps of STB-C software chips found in Beovision Televisions in the following (but not exclusively), sets:
- AV9000  
- MX7000  
- MX4000  
- AVANT 32  
- Beovision 3  
- Beosystem 2  
and more

There is potential that these chips work in the 28" chassis of the era, but i haven't got categoric proof of that. This is aimed at mainly 32" CRTs between 1995-2005 but also includes some 4:3 sets.
