# Beocord VX7000

## Summary

This page contains ROM dumps of software found in VX7000 VCRs and AV9000 television sets with the integrated VCR.

The following information was taken from a BeoWorld forum article based on the VX7000.

Known software versions are: 1.2, 1.3, 1.37, 2.3, 3.1

1.2, 1.3, 2.3 and 1.37 are two-way version, the 3.1 is one-way
1.3 and 2.3 are almost identical, the 2.3 was made for the built-in Version of the AV9000, some colours of the menus are differnt.
1.37 uses a different decoder for the VPS Timer signal, so this Version cannot be downgraded. Sometimes especially this newer v1.37 has trouble with timer recordings.
3.1 was used with the newer Beo4.

In V1.3 and V2.3 is a bug: after you selected Software Version, the VX will will not react to any command. Unplug it from mains.
