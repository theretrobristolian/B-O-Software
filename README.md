<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was started in 2022 inspired by my continued desire to preserve and maintain, vintage equipment from Bang and Olufsen. In recent times I have had multiple correspondences with Bang and Olufsen through their website support feature and sadly they seem to have little understanding or care for why having service manuals and dumps of software are so important. For this reason I have been forced to start this repository and try to lead by example, backing up what I can and sharing it publicly so others in the community can benefit and hopefully enjoy their products for years to come.

This project and this journey isn't all about me, in fact - it's far from it. I would love to see others in the community contribute to this project and of course would fully credit them with the uploads. Please, if you have the capability, backup your ROMS, share them with me directly to upload, or if you have more knowledge of how github works, contribute through a fork or being a direct contributor.
